# Module 1. **Computer Science.**

<br>
	
  Computer science is the study of problems, problem-solving, and the solutions that come out of the problem-solving process. Given a problem, a computer scientistâ€™s goal is to develop an algorithm, a stepby-step list of instructions for solving any instance of the problem that might arise. Algorithms are finiteprocesses that if followed will solve the problem. Algorithms are solutions.

# Module 2. **Programming.**

<br>

Programming is the process of taking an algorithm and encoding it into a notation, a programming language, so that it can be executed by a computer. Although many programming languages and many different types of computers exist, the important first step is the need to have the solution. Without an algorithm there can be no program.

# Module 3. **Object Oriented Programming.**

<br>
  
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model organized around objects rather than "actions" and data rather than logic. Historically, a program has been viewed as a logical procedure that takes input data, processes it, and produces output data.

## OOP Concepts
<ol>
<li>classes</li>
<li>object</li>
<li>instances</li>
<li>Encapsulation of Data</li>
<li>Inheritance</li>
<li>constructors</li>
